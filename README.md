VMXS: Vagrant list access info of running VMs

Written by: Zheng-Da Tan

Pre-requisites: This script is quite useless without Perl and Vagrant

This is a simple Perl script for Vagrant users to list access information (IP Address, Username and Local SSH Port Number) of all their running VMs.

To use, simply download 'vmxs', place it in a folder in your $PATH, and make it executable (for example, 'chmod 755').

Example:
```
$ vmxs
======== ========== ====== ======== ========================
ID       DIRECTORY  L_PORT USER     IP ADDRESSES
======== ========== ====== ======== ========================
1a2b3c4  instance1  2222   vagrant  10.0.2.15 192.168.1.115
5d6e7f8  instance2  2200   ubuntu   10.0.2.15 192.168.1.109
```
